        <p> The Philippine Animal Welfare Society, PAWS for short, is a registered non-profit organization that is dedicated to the 
        protection and promotion of humane treatment of all animals. I have chosen this charity organization because it promotes animal 
        welfare, which is essential for protecting the animals found in our communities. So, why do I support this organization? 
        Here are my top reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> To raise awareness of the proper treatment of animals, both domestic and strays, in our respective communities</li>
          <li> Promote adoption of pets instead of purchasing, because some animals come from pet mills that have harsh conditions for animals</li>
          <li> Show support for RA 8485, which is the Animal Welfare Act. It prevents cruelty, maltreatment, and neglect of animals, with penalties like imprisonment and fines for violations
        </ul>
      </div>
